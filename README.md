# Computer-Vision-Based-Web-App

This project is divided in different parts:
* CatVsDogs model - A model that classifies an image as a cat or a dog. It is based on use of Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN's). Different architectures (different settings of convolutional layers) were trained and their performance was recorded to find the most accurate model.
* YOLOv3 model implementation was to get familiar with the YOLO algorithms, one of the fastest object detection methods available. Learning how dows YOLO algorithms work and how are they faster than others.
* Making a web based based on Computer Vision using flask framework. This was the major part of the project. YOLOv5 is implemented to detect, classify and put bounded boxes in a live stream of images (coming from webcam). The output is rendered on a simple web page, which also includes live updating list of objects.
